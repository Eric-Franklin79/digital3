<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Catch all the dogs before the time runs out.

I want the player to enjoy catching the dogs.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The genre of this game is a casual action game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You can move your player with the arrow keys, he sing his net by pressing spacebar. The dogs casually move around the screen. Every 5 seconds, for ever 2 dogs a new dog is created.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Using different player objectives to see how many different ways you can play one game.EX: how fast you can complete the game, how high a score you can get, trying to finish the game by only catching a certain amount of dogs, ect.
</li>

One feature of the game is that every 5 seconds two dogs create another dog. This inceases the amount of enimies as you play.

Player stategies for this game would be to concentrate on the area with the most dogs first. If you let there be a lot of dogs then more will apear.
If the player is going for a high score then they might allow more dogs to appear at the begining.
</li>
